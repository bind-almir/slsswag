# slsswag

The idea comes from several projects that I was migrating to serverless architecture using Serverless framework. There is an existing OpenAPI specification, but there is no good way to migrate it to Serverless. You have to define all the endpoints over and over again which is a kind of redundant work. 

Status: Experimental

usage:
- `slsswag swagger.yml nodejs`
- `slsswag swagger.yml csharp`
